<h2>ðŸŒ Overview</h2>
Omnifood is a fully responsive website designed to provide a seamless food subscription service that delivers healthy meals directly to your door. Our goal is to make eating well convenient and accessible for everyone, every day of the year.

<h3>ðŸ’œDesign Philosophy</h3>

The design philosophy centers around user experience and accessibility. I believe that a great website should not only look good but also function perfectly across all devices and platforms. That's why I've put a significant emphasis on responsive design, ensuring that Omnifood delivers an optimal experience whether you're on a desktop, tablet, or mobile device.
